STREET GAMES<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>There’s not much for <i>us</i> to do,
down our way—in the way of sports,
I mean. Nothing at all, in fact. When
we come home from work we generally
go straight indoors and have a lay-down,
and a cup of tea and a pipe;
or else we go out and watch a match
somewhere. There’s always the
“Three Swans”, of course....</p>

<p>But the youngsters get on all right—seem
to, at all events. Some of them
have got bats and stumps or footballs,
and off they go into the park;
and some of the girls have got shuttlecocks,
and off <i>they</i> go. But most of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
them haven’t, you know; so they just
lark about where they are. <span class="smcap">Paper-chase</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">ROUNDERS</span>, for instance;
you know those? They’re plain sailing.
But some of these games, like <span class="allsmcap">EGG-IN-CAP</span>
(also called <span class="allsmcap">EGGET</span>), are rather
complicated; and as to <span class="allsmcap">MONDAY-TUESDAY</span>
(or <span class="allsmcap">NUMBERS</span>; another kind
of egg-in-cap)—it would take me till
next Saturday <i>week</i> to explain it.
Perhaps you can make it out from
this description:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“After clipping the throer calls
out the name of the day in the weke
and the chap whats taken that day
has to catch if he misses it they all
run away and shout no Egg if I move—becose
if they dont the throer can
say a egg if you move—&amp; that helps
to make the quantity of the Eggs.
The Misser of the ball throes it at
one of the player and if he misses it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
is a egg to him and if he hits its a
egg to the one he hit. After the
throer has hit his man—the man
has to throw it up again. If one
of the player catch the Ball they
throw it up again and call out the
name, the total of egg to get you
out is three. After the game is over
the winner has clockwork on the
Losers; they each stand up against
a wall wile the winner throes at
their heads with the ball. They can
also claim 3 Hard throes or six soft
ones.”</p>
</div>

<p>Now you know how it’s done.</p>

<p>Then there’s <span class="allsmcap">QUEENIE</span>, which is
really a girls’ game. One boy stands
on the kerbstone with his back to
the street, and they call him Queenie.
He throws a ball backwards over
his shoulders into the street, where
four others are standing to catch it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
As soon as one of them has it, they
all hold their hands behind their
backs, and then Queenie has to turn
round and face them and guess who
has the ball. If he guesses right, he
goes on being Queenie; if not, the
boy who has the ball takes his place.</p>

<p>Why they call it <span class="allsmcap">QUEENIE</span>? Because
that happens to be its name. Aunt
Eliza, who has travelled all over the
place and can explain mostly everything
(or thinks she can) tells me
that <span class="allsmcap">QUEENIE</span> is a Chinese game
and that she has seen it played there
and that it must have come to London
over the docks. I daresay it did.
But the worst of Aunt Eliza is that
you never know whether—</p>

<p>There are other ball-games, such
as <span class="allsmcap">HOT RICE</span> and <span class="allsmcap">FRENCH CRICKET</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">FOOTBALL-CRICKET</span> and <span class="allsmcap">FIDDLE-DE-DEE</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">PALM OVER</span> (a rough
game) and <span class="allsmcap">CATCH</span> (also called <span class="allsmcap">TEASER</span>),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
which goes not as you think it does,
but like this—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Two boys stand at each side of
the road and one in the middle,
that’s Hee. One of them tries to
get the ball over middle’s head for
the other to get it but if middle
gets it the throer goes Hee”—</p>
</div>

<p>and <span class="allsmcap">WALL-BOUNCING</span> and <span class="allsmcap">KING</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">MISSINGS OUT</span> and <span class="allsmcap">FRENCH FOOT</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">KNOCKING UP THREE CATCHERS</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">SWOLO</span> (rather like hockey) and <span class="allsmcap">DAYS
OF THE YEAR</span> and <span class="allsmcap">PUNCH-BALL</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">BOUNCE-BALL</span> and <span class="allsmcap">TOUCH IT RUN</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">HUNDRED WINS</span> (where you knock
bricks out of a ring with a ball) and
<span class="allsmcap">ONE-TWO-THREE-AND-A-LAIRY</span> (I wish
I knew what a-lairy meant) and
<span class="allsmcap">ALONG THE ROW</span> and <span class="allsmcap">UNDER THE ROW</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">ACROSS THE ROW</span> and <span class="allsmcap">RABBIT IN
THE HUTCH</span> and <span class="allsmcap">FIVE-TEN</span> and <span class="allsmcap">BASE<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></span>
(or <span class="allsmcap">DOLL</span>) and <span class="allsmcap">WALLIE</span> (because played
against a wall) and <span class="allsmcap">STRIKE UP KNOCK
DOWN</span> and <span class="allsmcap">IN THE HAT</span> and <span class="allsmcap">DUSTHOLES</span>,
and no doubt many more. But however
many I might tell you, there are
not nearly as many as there ought to
be.</p>

<p>Why not?</p>

<p>Well, Mr. Perkins—he works with
the firm of Framlingham Brothers
(Limited), a likeable well-spoken
gentleman, and he often watches the
children playing and sometimes we
have a talk about things at the
“Three Swans”—Mr. Perkins says,
speaking of ball-games, exactly what
I always say, which is this: that
there’s a difficulty about ball-games,
which is this: that most of them
generally need a ball; meaning you
can’t play with a ball unless you
have a ball to play with. And you
generally haven’t got one—meaning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
the children. And then the trouble
begins. Because then you have to
start thinking about something that
doesn’t need a ball.</p>

<p>Somebody or other may have a top,
for those who care about this kind of
game. Top-games are not as fashionable
as they used to be; still, there
are a good many of them left. You
can play <span class="allsmcap">TOP-FOOTBALL</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">SKATING</span>,
and <span class="allsmcap">GRULLEY</span> (also called <span class="allsmcap">GROWLEY</span>,
or <span class="allsmcap">GROWLING KEEPS</span>, or <span class="allsmcap">PLACING</span>),
and <span class="allsmcap">GETTING IN THE RING</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">SENDING
MESSAGES</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">GULLEY HOLE</span> (or
<span class="allsmcap">HULLY-GULLY</span>) and <span class="allsmcap">FLY DUTCHMAN</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">BACK SCALINGS</span> and <span class="allsmcap">TRACING</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">RAILWAY LINE</span> and <span class="allsmcap">MOUSETRAP</span> (where
you have to get the string wound
round the top as it spins) and <span class="allsmcap">CHUCKING</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">GRUDGES</span> and <span class="allsmcap">GULLEY KEEP
TOP</span> and <span class="allsmcap">GULLEY KNOCK ABOUT</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">FETCHING HOME</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">PEG IN THE
RING</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">BOAT-RACE</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">PEGGING</span>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">LIVE O’S</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">CHIPSTONE.</span> For
<span class="allsmcap">CHIPSTONE</span> you need hard smooth
ground and some pebbles and this is
how you play it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Two lines about 6 ft apart are
drorn. A boy first puts his stone
on a place half-way between the
two, he spins his top picks it up
and makes it spin in the palm of
his hand and chips his stone towards
the line. The first boy who gets
his stone beyond the line he wins.”</p>
</div>

<p>I used to know quite a good deal
about tops, but it’s quite a
while since I played, and I have
forgotten half their names, and
couldn’t describe them if I tried.
I can only remember peg-tops,
whipping-tops, mushrooms, klondykes,
tomtits, boxers (made of boxwood),
racing tops, corkscrews, clodhoppers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
humming tops, Russian
tops, Jews’ tops, Japan tops (rather
flatter at the end than the usual
kind), French tops (red and white
on the top, with a little thing for
tying a piece of string on, to spin
with), and window-breakers, which
are rather like mushrooms.</p>

<p><i>And</i> the dumb-bargee.</p>

<p>Ever heard of a dumb-bargee? It’s
a kind of top after the style of a
klondyke. It’s too heavy to rise
from the ground like a racer. You
simply can’t get a rise out of a dumb-bargee.
Perhaps that accounts for
the name. Because it’s easy enough
to get a rise out of an ordinary
bargee, isn’t it? And when you do,
he’s not exactly what you call
“dumb”, is he? Not the bargees
I’ve known.</p>

<p>And if you have no tops, you can
make up games with your caps or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
boots or jackets. <span class="smcap">Dead man’s rise</span>
(also called <span class="allsmcap">DEAD MAN’S DARK
SCENERY</span> or <span class="allsmcap">COAT</span>) is one of these
jacket-games, where one party has
to hide, covered up in their coats.
Shoe-games are rather commoner—there’s
<span class="allsmcap">SIZE OF YOUR BOOT</span> (one boy
has to be blindfolded for this), and
<span class="allsmcap">BOOT IN THE TUB</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">NAILS</span>, and
<span class="allsmcap">COBBLER COBBLER MEND MY SHOE</span>.
But the commonest are the cap-games.
Here are some of them:
<span class="allsmcap">CHIMNEY-POTS</span> (or <span class="allsmcap">UPSETTING THE
CHIMNEY</span>); <span class="allsmcap">HAT UNDER THE MOON</span>;
<span class="allsmcap">MOUSE IN TRAP</span>; <span class="allsmcap">SAUSAGE</span>; <span class="allsmcap">KNOCK
HIM DOWN DONKEY</span>; <span class="allsmcap">PULL FOR THE
SHORE SAILOR</span>; <span class="allsmcap">SUGAR AND MILK</span>;
<span class="allsmcap">HOP O’ MY THUMB</span>; <span class="allsmcap">TOUCH-CAP</span>. In
the three last you have to go
“through the mill”, if you fail.
<span class="smcap">Nuts in cap</span> is played with caps
and crackers (Spanish nuts); in <span class="allsmcap">HITTING
THE SUN</span> you must throw your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
cap at your opponent’s at about
twelve yards distance; other cap-games
are <span class="allsmcap">QUOITS</span> (with folded-up
caps), and <span class="allsmcap">FIRE ENGINES</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">SHYING
OVER THE MOON</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">SHOOTING THE
STARS</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">PILING THE DONKEY</span>, and
<span class="allsmcap">CAP IT</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">WHERE’S THIS LITTLE
HAT TO GO</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">SALLY ROUND THE
JAM-POT</span> (with piled-up caps), and
<span class="allsmcap">BALL IN CAP</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">RUN A MILE FOR
A HALF-PENNY</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">HOOK AND CAP</span>,
and <span class="allsmcap">HOT SOUP</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">FOX COME OUT
OF YOUR DEN</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">THROW OVER</span>, and
<span class="allsmcap">MILLER’S SACK</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">WHACK CAP</span>, and
<span class="allsmcap">HATCHING EGGS</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">UNDER THE
GARTER</span>. All these are played with
caps, and some of them, such as
<span class="allsmcap">FLIES</span> (or <span class="allsmcap">SALLY</span>) <span class="allsmcap">ROUND THE JAM-POT</span>,
are really duty-games, of which
I must tell you later on.</p>

<p>And if you have no caps, which
you sometimes haven’t, you must
just find something else to play with.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
Buttons, for instance—everybody
knows the old game of <span class="allsmcap">BUTTONS</span>
(or <span class="allsmcap">BANG-OUT</span>, or <span class="allsmcap">BANGINGS</span>) where
you pitch them against a wall and
have to measure the intervals between
them with the span of your fingers
and always end up with a row about
cheating distances. You can make a
fine gamble out of <span class="allsmcap">BUTTONS</span> if you
play the same game with halfpennies;
you can win quite a lot, when there
are no coppers about....</p>

<p>But nobody need play for money
unless they like, and, anyhow, I
don’t care to talk about these things.
Because, of course, our boys don’t
gamble, and there’s an end to it.
They never try to make money,
like some do, out of silly tricks
like <span class="allsmcap">BRAG</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">BOOKS</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">SPIN UP
THE PENNY</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">RAPS ON THE BUGLE</span>,
and <span class="allsmcap">NAP</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">TRUMP</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">BEAT YOUR
NEIGHBOUR OUT OF DOORS</span>, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span> <span class="allsmcap">MY
BIRDIE WHISTLES</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">POLISH BANKER</span>,
and <span class="allsmcap">DONKEY</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">TUPPENCE YOU HEAD
IT</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">PITCHING UP THE LINE</span> (double
or single), and <span class="allsmcap">SHOVE HA’PENNY</span>, and
<span class="allsmcap">NEAREST THE LINE TAKES</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">CHUCK-FARDEN</span>,
and <span class="allsmcap">PONTOON</span>,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and <span class="allsmcap">PIEMAN</span>,
and <span class="allsmcap">ODD MAN SPINS</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">ON THE STICK</span>,
and <span class="allsmcap">GUESSING WITH THREE CARDS</span>, and
<span class="allsmcap">GUESSING WITH SIX CARDS</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">ANCHOR-CROWN-HEAD</span>,
and <span class="allsmcap">PITCH AND TOSS</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">BLIND SAM</span> and <span class="allsmcap">OVERS KEEPS</span>—or
whatever all these things are called;
no, not <i>our</i> boys. They never climb
down to the cut<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> on a Sunday afternoon
like some people do—although,
as a matter of fact, it’s a pretty safe
place just now, because only three
weeks ago a couple of peelers were
chucked into the water for interfering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>Many of these sports are played
with cigarette-cards or with ordinary
playing cards, or with either; and
I might tell you the names of some
of those of the first kind, seeing that
the lads have to play their card-games
out of doors, hereabouts, if—if it
weren’t for the gambling they lead
to. For instance, there’s <span class="allsmcap">KNOCKING
DOLLY OUT O’ BED</span> where you lay
down three for a king, two for a
jack, one for a queen and none for an
ace, and—well, there you are! You
must just come and ask some of the
boys higher up the street; maybe
they’ve heard of the game<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>. Ours
are respectable. Gambling is forbidden
by law, and they know it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
That’s why you have to be so darned
careful not to get copped.</p>

<p>Or you can play with tins, or bits
of metal and wood, or with nuts.
In <span class="allsmcap">THROWING THE NICKER</span> (or <span class="allsmcap">TIN
ON THE LINE</span>) you really ought to
use a piece of lead or tin, or an old
key, but sometimes you haven’t got
one, and then you must put up with
a slate; and the same with <span class="allsmcap">NIXIE</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">PITCH OUT</span> and <span class="allsmcap">PITCHING ON
THE HAT</span> and <span class="allsmcap">PITCHING IN THE HAT</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">BULLS EYE</span> and <span class="allsmcap">ONE, TWO, THREE</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">OVER THE LINE</span>. There are many
tin-can games, such as <span class="allsmcap">TIN-CAN BUMP</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">TIN-CAN JUMP</span> and <span class="allsmcap">TIN-CAN CATCH</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">TIN-CAN FISHING</span> and <span class="allsmcap">TIN-CAN
FETCH IT</span> and <span class="allsmcap">TIN-CAN RACING</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">TIN-CAN GO IT</span> and <span class="allsmcap">TIN-CAN TOUCH</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">TIN-CAN HIDE IT</span> and <span class="allsmcap">TIN-CAN
HAVE IT</span> and <span class="allsmcap">COCK-SHY</span> and <span class="allsmcap">CATCH
THE RIDER</span> and <span class="allsmcap">PITCHING UP THE
WALL</span>. The best of all of them is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">TIN-CAN COPPER</span> (or <span class="allsmcap">KICK-CAN POLICEMAN</span>)
which goes like this:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You get a tin and place it on the
road. You then toss up who is to
be tin-can copper. After the one is
found you throw it up the street &amp;
then go and hide. The one who has
to go after the can must not turn
round and must come back backwards.
When he has got back he
puts the tin down &amp; then looks to
see if he can see you—if he see you
he points were you are and shout your
name &amp; Bangs the can down three
times, if he does not see you you
can creep up and steal the can &amp;
fling it up the road again and all of
them can hide. The last one caught
is the Tin-can-Copper”.</p>
</div>

<p>There are different ways of playing
<span class="allsmcap">TIPPIT</span> and I can’t stop to explain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
them; one is played with sticks,
and one without, and another with
tin; and you can play tippit with a
top and a coin; in fact, it’s one of
those names, like “fire-engines” or
“pitching up the line”, that don’t
mean anything in particular and are
used for all kinds of sports. With
sticks you can also play <span class="allsmcap">CUNJER</span>,
and <span class="allsmcap">CATCHING THE FALLING WAND</span>
(a ring-game for children) and
<span class="allsmcap">SEIZING STICKS</span> (or <span class="allsmcap">SCOTCH AND
ENGLISH</span>):—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“One of A.’s side tries to rush and
get a stick from B.’s side without
being caught. If he is caught he
remains a prisoner, unless touched
by one of his own side again. But
no sticks can be taken by any one
while there are prisoners. The game
is won by the side who get all the
sticks”—</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>and <span class="allsmcap">WAND BALANCE RACE</span> and different
kinds of <span class="allsmcap">TIBBY-CAT</span> (or <span class="allsmcap">NIBBY-CAP</span>)
such as <span class="allsmcap">SETS</span> and <span class="allsmcap">RUNS</span> and <span class="allsmcap">WOGGLES</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">CATCHERS</span> and <span class="allsmcap">SINGLES</span>. You
can’t play <span class="allsmcap">TIBBY-CAT</span> if there are any
blue boys hanging around; they’re
down on the game, because people
sometimes get their windows smashed
or their eyes bunged up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hitting the mummy</span> is played
with nuts—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You throw nuts against a wall and
let them lay there till one of them is
hit, then he who hits has the lot.
But if he doesn’t leave Mummy
laying down he has to pay six.”</p>
</div>

<p>With nuts (or cherry-stones or
date-stones) you can also play <span class="allsmcap">YOU
HAVE ALL YOU GET</span> and <span class="allsmcap">KNOCK HIM
DOWN HAVE HIM</span> and <span class="allsmcap">TIP-TAP</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">MOP CHERRY-STONES</span> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">UP THE GUTTER-SPOUT</span>; as well as another
game for which you need nuts and
an old tobacco-tin. I can’t tell you
its name, because I don’t know it;
and the lads can’t tell you either,
because it hasn’t got one—not yet.
It’s quite a new game.</p>

<p>But some of the best sports are
those which they make up without
anything at all, just out of their
heads, like <span class="allsmcap">STAGS</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">FOX-HUNTING</span>,
and <span class="allsmcap">SHOEING THE WILD HORSE</span> (you
need confederates for this, and a
fresh boy; but it’s quite a respectable
game), and <span class="allsmcap">TOMMY ALL ROUND</span>,
and <span class="allsmcap">BLIND DONKEY</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">SAILOR</span>, and
<span class="allsmcap">HORSE-SOLDIERS</span>. <span class="smcap">Horse-soldiers</span>
(also called <span class="allsmcap">FLYING ANGELS</span>) is rather
rough, and so is <span class="allsmcap">COCK AND HEN
FIGHT</span>. Or hide-and-seek games like
<span class="smcap">I spy—spit in your eye</span>, which
goes like this:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Five or ten can play, one has to
hide wile the Others hide. If he
sees you you have to come out of
your Crib &amp; twig &amp; get home. The
one that hides can only come a little
way from home—to get home you
have to run and touch the piller or
Post where he was hiding”.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Point</span> is like I spy; but you need
a lamp-post for it. <span class="smcap">Monkey in the
wood</span> is the same kind of game, but
without a lamp-post; <span class="allsmcap">FORTY</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">INNER AND OUTER</span> are other hide-and-seek
games. Or hunting sports like
<span class="allsmcap">WIDDY</span>, which you play in winter to
get warm with. There are different
ways of playing <span class="allsmcap">WIDDY</span>; one is this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Say there’s ten of you, one is
widdy, that’s Hee. He runs after the
others till he catches his one then
there’s two that must hold hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
then they run after the eight till they
catch another and so on till there all
cort and the last one to be cawt
is widdy for next go”.</p>
</div>

<p>Or you can make <span class="allsmcap">WIDDY</span> into a
hopping game. One is “he”, they
all gather round him and sing—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Widdy Widdy way, I shan’t play,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Kick your post and run away—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and then he kicks his lamp-post and
hops after them on one leg. I don’t
know what “Widdy” means, but
I should think that all these hunting
“he” games are rather old (other
“he” games are sometimes new).
<span class="smcap">Fishing</span> (or <span class="allsmcap">FAG-OUT</span>) is another of
them, and <span class="allsmcap">COALER</span> another, and <span class="allsmcap">LAST
ONE HOME</span> another.</p>

<p>To play <span class="allsmcap">DELIVER UP THOSE GOLDEN
JEWELS</span> (or <span class="allsmcap">DELIVER UP THE BLACK
PUDDING</span>) you need confederates. You
go up to a soft boy and say “Let’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
have a game of Deliver up those
Golden Jewels <i>and you shall be
judge</i>.” So the softy gets very
keen about being judge, and sits
down “in Court” on a step or
somewhere; then they lead up the
prisoner who is in the know, you
know, and they ask him a lot of
sham questions; and as soon as
the judge says “Therefore deliver
up them golden jools”, the prisoner—no,
I can’t tell you any more
about that game. It’s rather rude.
None of our boys are caught at it
more than once—not at playing the
judge, at least. There are other games
of this sort, like <span class="allsmcap">WHITE MICE</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">HIGH TREASON</span> and <span class="allsmcap">THREE GOLDEN
BALLS</span> and <span class="allsmcap">FARMER LEFT HIS HAT
BEHIND</span> and <span class="allsmcap">SCORING</span> and <span class="allsmcap">RUNNING
TOO FAST</span> and <span class="allsmcap">HIDE AND SEEK</span> (<i>not</i>
the usual kind); they can all be
played in a respectable fashion, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
the worst of it is, they generally
aren’t. Another is called <span class="allsmcap">P.....E</span>.
That’s worse. I can’t say anything
whatever about it except that you
need good confederates and a boy
who is quite new to the quarter.
And some of them are still worse;
not at all nice, in fact. If you want
to find out about them, you must
come yourself and talk to a few of
our rough chaps. You might ask
them about <span class="allsmcap">TOUCHING THE KING’S
SCEPTRE</span>. If you can get that out of
them, you can get anything....</p>

<p>Now I daresay you’ve heard of
leap-frog, and maybe you think there’s
only one way of playing it. Well, if
you want to see how our boys can
invent things out of their heads
because, and only because, they have
no bats or other things to play with,
you should come and watch them at
their leap-frog and duty games. (In
leap-frog and overbacks they go in
certain fixed orders over each others’
backs; in duty one man stays down
until another fails in the duty and
takes his place). Always inventing
new kinds, too. You could write a
whole book about sports of this
kind, each with its separate rules
and separate name—fancy names they
are, some of them—and each with its
“showman” or “duty-man” or
“namer” who decides what things
are to be done. There’s <span class="allsmcap">ALL THE
WINKLES</span>, a grand game for as many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
as you like; and <span class="allsmcap">HOPPING TO LONDON</span>

<span class="allsmcap">HOPPING ROUND BIG BEN</span> and <span class="allsmcap">ALL
HANDS ON DECK</span> (also called <span class="allsmcap">FINGER
ON THE BLOCK</span>). <span class="smcap">Cut-a-lump</span> (or
<span class="allsmcap">CUTTER</span>)—that’s another kind. Bill
bends down in the gutter, while the
others stand up behind him in a row;
the first of them is called cut-a-lump.
He goes over Bill’s back, and where
his feet touch the ground—there he
makes a mark; then the next boy,
without moving from his old place,
has to jump over Bill and touch the
same mark; then the next, and the
next—over they go! Of course, it
becomes more difficult with each
jump, as the distance gets wider.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
Whoever first misses the mark must
take the place of Bill, who then
becomes cutter in his turn. That’s
cut-a-lump: see?</p>
</div>

<p>Why it’s called cut-a-lump?</p>

<p>Because he cuts a lump off the
distance in front of Bill.</p>

<p>Warnie, I suppose, means “I warn

Nacko—they sometimes call it Jimmy
Wagtail, but one of the lads tells
me it means “Neck, ho!” which
only shows how they like twisting
the names about. (That’s why
they now say shuttlecock instead
of shuttlecork, because they forget
it’s played with a cork). What I
think about Jimmy Nacko is this:
judging by his name, he was just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
an old shonk<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> of some kind....</p>

<p>And now I must tell you about
<span class="allsmcap">RELEASE</span>. There is one game of this
kind played by small children, and
not worth talking about. But the real
<span class="allsmcap">RELEASE</span> (or <span class="allsmcap">ROBBERS AND COPPERS</span>) is
quite another thing altogether. In
release you take sides and catch prisoners;
you have to touch their
heads and “crown” them; that’s
what makes them prisoners. And
that’s what makes them so wild—because
the other chaps can’t always
release them; and that’s why the
old people bar the game—because
you always get your clothes torn;
and that’s why it’s also called
<span class="allsmcap">BEDLAM</span>—because there are so many
rows while it’s going on. You
see, they don’t like being made
prisoners and being “crowned”
and having their heads touched—not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
at all, at all. Just mad, it
makes them.</p>

<p>“D’ye want a claht over the jor?”
says one. “’Cos yer never did touch
me ’ead, so there.”</p>

<p>“Ole Ikey see’d me doos it.”</p>

<p>“Liar. ’Cos ’e wos t’ovver side

<p>“’E never. Yer wos on the grahnd

<p>Girls’ games? Bless you, dozens of
them.</p>
</div>

<p>They play sports together with the
boys: ball-games like <span class="allsmcap">ROUNDERS</span>
(“<span class="allsmcap">FOUR CORNERS</span>”) and <span class="allsmcap">HEAD GAME</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">DAGGLES</span> and <span class="allsmcap">BROKEN BOTTLE</span>
(yes; <span class="allsmcap">BROKEN BOTTLE</span> is a ball-game,
and is also called <span class="allsmcap">PASSING ROUND</span>)
and <span class="allsmcap">THREE CATCHES OUT</span> and <span class="allsmcap">ROTTEN
EGG</span> (or <span class="allsmcap">CRACKED EGG</span>) and <span class="allsmcap">A AND B</span>,
where they have to stand in four
rings marked in chalk on the pavement;
and some without balls such
as <span class="allsmcap">FOOL, FOOL, COME TO SCHOOL</span>
(rather like <span class="allsmcap">DUNCE, DUNCE, DOUBLE
D.</span>) and <span class="allsmcap">WRINKLE-SHELLS</span> and <span class="allsmcap">HARK
THE ROBBERS COMING THROUGH</span>—an
old catch game—and <span class="allsmcap">STEPS</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">SLY
FOX</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">LET GO MUST GO</span> (a wall
game) and <span class="allsmcap">HONEY-POTS</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Honey-pots</span> is very respectable,
but a little old-fashioned. Aunt
Eliza says she used to play it, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
can quite believe that. I can just
see her playing <span class="allsmcap">HONEY-POTS</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Please we’ve come to learn a
trade</span> (also called <span class="allsmcap">GUESSING WORDS</span>
or <span class="allsmcap">DUMB MOTIONS</span>)—another game for
boys and girls. There are two
parties, one on each side of the street.
One of them has to think of a trade,
such as picking hops, for instance;
then they take the first letters, P
and H, and go over to the others
and say “We have come to work
a trade.” When the others ask,
“What’s your trade?” they must
answer “P. H.”, and pretend to be
picking hops with their hands. If
the others guess what trade they
mean, they must shout it out and
chase them across the street; and
if they catch one of them—why,
then they, the hop-pickers, must do
the guessing instead. <span class="smcap">Catch-in-the-rope</span>
is also for boys and girls, and so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
is <span class="allsmcap">PUSSY CAT</span>, and so is <span class="allsmcap">STATUES</span>.
There are <span class="allsmcap">UGLY STATUES</span> and <span class="allsmcap">PRETTY STATUES</span>. When you play this game
you have to line yourselves up against
a wall or a house; then the judge
comes along and pulls one of you
forwards and in that moment you
have to make a posture and a face,
sometimes pretty but mostly ugly,
and pretend to be a statue. It spoils
everything if you laugh over this
game, as you may understand from
this description:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A lot of players stand on a form.
One person in front tells the person
to form a statue if she move or laugh
she is hee—”</p>
</div>

<p>Another of them is <span class="allsmcap">HERE WE
GO UP THE MULBERRY TREE</span>, where
they form two parties who challenge
each other and try to pull each other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
across the street. And they have
handkerchief games together such as
<span class="smcap">I sent a letter to my love</span> (“and
on the way I dropped it”, a decent
game for boys and girls, also called
<span class="allsmcap">LOST LETTER</span>; and if you haven’t
got a handkerchief, which you generally
haven’t, you can take any old
rag); and <span class="allsmcap">NICK NACK TOLLY WHACK</span>,
which is rather rough and goes like
this:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Pick up for sides and one side
says nick nack tolly wack. Then if
the other side does not move they
rush and each one has to have a wack
with the tolly wack (a handkerchief
with a knot in it).”</p>
</div>

<p>There are several more of these
games for boys and girls—such as
<span class="allsmcap">LOOKING GLASS</span> and <span class="allsmcap">GOOSE-GANDER</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">SNOW-WHITE</span> (where they go on hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
and knees and get very dirty) and
<span class="allsmcap">PET POST</span>—but not as many as there
might be, because they don’t play
together as much as they might....</p>

<p>Then the girls have games to themselves:
ball-games like <span class="allsmcap">MACKINTOSH</span>,
and <span class="allsmcap">BASKET-BALL</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">CROSS-BALL</span>,
and <span class="allsmcap">EMPEROR BALL</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">CENTRE BALL</span>,
and <span class="allsmcap">CORNER CATCH BALL</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">CIRCLE
STRIDE BALL</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">HAND BALL</span>, and
<span class="allsmcap">ONE IN THE MIDDLE</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">QUEEN MAB</span>
(a ball-hiding game, also called <span class="allsmcap">QUEEN
ANNE</span>); and hand-clapping games
such as <span class="allsmcap">ONE-TWO-THREE</span> and <span class="allsmcap">ORANGES,
ORANGES, FOUR A PENNY</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">TWISTERS
AND CLAPS</span>; and ring games like <span class="allsmcap">UP
TO THE RING</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">RUNNING IN AND
OUT THE BLUEBELLS</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">FIRE</span>, and
<span class="allsmcap">WALKING ROUND THE VILLAGE</span>, and
<span class="allsmcap">THIEF, PRINCE, KING, QUEEN, BEGGAR</span>,
and <span class="allsmcap">THROWING THE BEAN-BAGS</span>, and
<span class="allsmcap">PRETTY AND UGLY</span>—where one girl
stands in the centre of the ring and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
picks out another one who has to
make a face, and if she’s satisfied
with the face, she allows her to
stand in the centre instead.</p>

<p>Other girls’ games are <span class="allsmcap">MOTHER I’M
OVER THE WATER</span> and <span class="allsmcap">BOX NUTS</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">VICTORIA</span> and <span class="allsmcap">TURNING MOTHER’S
WRINGER</span> and <span class="allsmcap">WE THREE KINGS</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">JOHN BROWN’S KNAPSACK</span> and <span class="allsmcap">FILLING</span>
(or <span class="allsmcap">PUSHING THROUGH</span>) <span class="allsmcap">THE GAP</span> and
<span class="smcap">when I was a schoolgirl</span> and <span class="allsmcap">BREAD
AND BUTTER</span> (shuttlecock game) and
<span class="allsmcap">COME TO SEE POOR MARY</span> and <span class="allsmcap">WE
ARE ROMANS</span> (two parties of girls)
and <span class="allsmcap">WHAT IS IT</span> and <span class="allsmcap">WHO KNOWS</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">HOW, WHEN AND WHERE</span> and <span class="allsmcap">HEAD
AND SHOULDERS</span> and <span class="allsmcap">BEAST, BIRD, FISH,
FLOWER</span> and <span class="allsmcap">POLLY GOES TO BED</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">POOR POLLY CAN’T SEE</span> and <span class="allsmcap">TAG</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">RAILWAY RACE</span> and <span class="allsmcap">ON THE MOUNTAIN</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">HOOK AND EYE</span> and <span class="allsmcap">EGG IN THE
SPOON</span> and <span class="allsmcap">HAWK AND DOVE</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">BORROW A LIGHT</span> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span> <span class="allsmcap">PEASE CODS</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">GOLDEN GOOSE</span> and <span class="allsmcap">TREACLE PUDDING</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">WHO’S AFRAID OF BLACK
PETER</span> and <span class="allsmcap">JENNY PLUCK PEARS</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">WALKING-STICKS</span> and <span class="allsmcap">LOOKING FOR
MOTHER’S THIMBLE</span> and <span class="allsmcap">TIME</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">LADYSMITH</span> and <span class="allsmcap">PUSHY BACK</span> and <span class="allsmcap">PASS
OVER</span> and <span class="allsmcap">WE ARE BRITISH SOLDIERS</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">L. S. D.</span> and the <span class="allsmcap">WHITE SHIRT</span>.
<span class="smcap">The white shirt</span> is an old ghost
game, played like this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You have a lot of girls standing
against a wall, one of them being
the mother of the others. She tells
them to go and see if father’s shirt’s
dry (the shirt being a girl in white,
standing at a distance). They go
in turn to see if it is dry &amp; each time
the “ghost” in father’s shirt catches
one. At last the mother alone is left,
she goes and is caught; then another
“shirt” is picked, and so the game
goes on.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>I don’t think Aunt Eliza ever played
<span class="allsmcap">THE WHITE SHIRT</span>; she wouldn’t care
about the name—</p>

<p>and <span class="allsmcap">MERRY MONTH OF MAY</span> and <span class="allsmcap">CON-STANT-I-NO-PLE</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">BLACK AND BLUE</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">FOLLOW YOUR MOTHER TO MARKET</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">PUSS</span> and <span class="allsmcap">MY SISTER JANE</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">TWO LITTLE PEOPLE WENT OUT ONE
DAY</span> (“As they went out they were
heard to say”) and <span class="allsmcap">OLD DEVIL IN
FIRE</span> (or <span class="allsmcap">LIGHT MOTHER’S COPPER FIRE</span>),
which is played so:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“About one dozen girls can play.
They select one who has to be the
devil, she’s to stand against a wall,
with a girl hid behind her. All the
children have to try and light the fire,
and each time the girl behind pinches
them and they say “Oh, mother, the
devil’s in fire.” Then the mother
tries to light the fire and the devil
chases them, and the one who is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
caught has to become devil, next
time.”</p>
</div>

<p>It’s perfectly certain Aunt Eliza
never played <span class="allsmcap">OLD DEVIL</span>.</p>

<p>And other girls’ games are <span class="allsmcap">JACOB
AND RACHEL</span> (where two of them
have to chase each other blindfolded)
and <span class="allsmcap">BUSHEL BASKET</span> and <span class="allsmcap">MRS. BROWN</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">WOODEN LEG</span> and <span class="allsmcap">ROLLING PIN</span>
(two parties of girls who decide
which of them has to chase the other
by the red or blue colour marked on
a rolling pin which is rolled between
them) and <span class="allsmcap">PORK AND GREENS</span>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“One player asks a question and
the next says pork and greens. If
she says anything else she is out—”</p>
</div>

<p>and <span class="allsmcap">TWO’S AND THREE’S</span>—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“A double ring is formed. Then
two children are out, they chase
each other &amp; one runs in front of a

</div>

<p>and <span class="allsmcap">BUZZ</span>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“One player count one then the
next says two and so on. Every 5
the player instead says buzz—”</p>
</div>

<p>and <span class="allsmcap">PARSON’S CAT</span>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Children sit down in a ring and
begin saying something about the
cat such as Abomnerble Cat. Then
B and so on.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I spy with one eye</span> and <span class="allsmcap">BLACK
IN TOPPER</span> and <span class="allsmcap">LOOKING THROUGH
THE KEY-HOLE</span> and <span class="allsmcap">PEEPING BEHIND
THE CURTAIN</span> are hiding games for
girls. For <span class="allsmcap">SWINGS</span> you need a lamp-post
and a piece of rope; it’s not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
exactly a game, but you can spend
a nice Sunday afternoon over it,
if there are no coppernobs about.
In <span class="allsmcap">POLLY TELL ME THE TIME</span> they
wind a skipping-rope round a girl’s
waist a certain number of times,
and then unwind her.</p>

<p>And that reminds me that some
of the best girls’ games are with
skipping ropes.</p>

<p>They have <span class="allsmcap">SWING-SWONG</span>, and
<span class="allsmcap">DOUBLE DUTCH</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">AMERICAN JUMP</span>,
and <span class="allsmcap">HIGHER AND HIGHER</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">RUN

<p>Some of the hand-clapping and
ring and skipping games—most of
them, in fact, and other ones too,
in which the boys used to join—have
songs that go with them; <span class="allsmcap">BOYS’
NAMES</span>, for instance, begins like this:</p>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Black-currant—red-currant—raspberry tart:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tell me the name of your sweetheart,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and then they begin with A. B. C.,
and all through the alphabet, a skip
with each letter; and when they
have found the sweetheart’s name
they have to discover when they
are to be married, and how many
rings, and how many brooches, and
in what clothes, and in what carriage,
and how many kisses, and in what
house they will live, and how many
children—all in the same alphabetical
manner; so that, if this game were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
ever properly finished, it would take
at least a month’s hard skipping.
Others of them end either with the
numbers 1, 2, 3, etc.; or with penny,
tuppence, threepence, etc.; or with
the things in the cruet-stand (salt,
mustard, vinegar, pepper); or with
the days of the week, or the months
of the year.</p>

<p>You can get as many of these songs
out of the girls as you like, if you
care to come round and ask for them;
you’ll find the girls far less shy
about their games than the boys are.
And you’ll also notice that they’re just
as good at inventing sports—the boys
show up best in the duty-games,
and the girls in their songs. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
there’s this difference. You’ll not
find much talk in these songs about
sunshine and flowers and things like
that—except in the older ones which
I think were used by girls and boys
together, and perhaps even by grown-ups.
The girls don’t discover poetic
things like “Swimming in Blue
Water” or “Dead Man’s Dark
Scenery”; they’re matter-of-fact;
they sing about clothes and food and
money. That’s what makes Aunt
Eliza say that women have more
common sense than men....</p>

<p>(the mother runs after the children
and the first one caught takes her

<span class="allsmcap">CHERRY-BOBS</span>) and <span class="allsmcap">CHERRY-PIES</span>.</p>

<p>That reminds me that the last
two must not be mixed up with
<span class="allsmcap">CHERRY-BOB ARCH</span>, a gambling game
for bigger lads, quite simple but
rather risky, played with cherry-stones
and the lid of an old wooden
box in which spaces and numbers
have been marked out. You throw
and—well, you must ask some of
the boys higher up the street....</p>

<p>Now small children don’t invent
games (it’s the older ones who do
that) and so they carry on a good few
which used to be played long ago
and which the others don’t care for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
any more. That accounts for the
queer sports you see among the kids.
One of them is <span class="allsmcap">KING OF THE BARBARY</span>,
where one party captures a “castle”
made of the other children holding
their hands together. Another is
<span class="allsmcap">GREEN MAN RISE-O</span>, a very old game;
it goes like this:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A boy has to get don and put
some gass over him and run out
and call out geren man rays and he
got to fine [find] you—”</p>
</div>

<p>Perhaps this is clearer:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The way we play the game of
greenman one of us lay down and
cover his self with grass and the
others run out and hide then they say
greenman greenman rise up then he
gets up and trys to catch them and
the last one thats cort goes it—”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>For <span class="allsmcap">GREEN MAN RISE-O</span> you have to
go to the park, nowadays; but if
you can’t go to the park, and want
to play it in the street, this is how
you do:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A boy as got to lay down and all
the others have to put thier coats
on him and then they have to say
green man rise up and if he see a boy
he as got to say one, two, three, and
the last one as to go it—”</p>
</div>

<p>—in fact, it becomes like <span class="allsmcap">DEAD MAN’S
RISE</span>, for lack of grass.</p>

<p>In <span class="allsmcap">COCK ROBIN IS DEAD</span> all the
children who are playing have to
arm themselves with shields (for
which they use saucepan-lids) and
with bows and arrows; and some
of the bows are worth looking at—made
of string, they are, and half a
barrel-hoop or a whalebone out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
their big sister’s stays—if she wears
any. Another of these sports is an
old witch-game called <span class="allsmcap">TO BECKLES
TO BECKLES</span> (?Beccles in Suffolk).
It is played like this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The children form a ring, and
two in the middle. One is a witch
and the other is a girl. The children
dance round once. Then the girl
in the ring says, “To Beckles to
Beckles to get some wood.” Old
witch says: “What for.” Girl: “To
boil the pot.” Witch: “What for.”
Girl: “To cook the fowl.” Witch:
“Where did you get it?” Girl:
“From your yard.” At this a race
ensues, until the girl is caught by
the witch.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Grottoes</span>—May sport—are built
heart-shaped or square or round,
with an edge of grass (if you can get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
it) filled up with picture-cards and
oyster-shells and old scent bottles
or anything else that looks pretty.
It’s just a dodge for mumping halfpennies;
and not a bad one, either.
They come up to you and say
“Remember the grotto”—meaning
Pay up. Speaking for myself, I
generally forget the grotto—meaning
Go to blazes. But some people
pay up, and I once saw Mr. Perkins
give them sixpence! He was a bit
all right, that evening—must have
been....</p>

<p>By far the best children’s games
are those played with mud. Of
mud you make <span class="allsmcap">PIES</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">BRIDGES</span>,
and <span class="allsmcap">STICKING-BRICKS</span> (against a wall),
and <span class="allsmcap">MUD-CARTS</span> (played with a tin-can),
and <span class="allsmcap">WELLS</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">TUNNELS</span>, and
<span class="allsmcap">FLOWER-POTS</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">CASTLES</span>—in fact,
anything you please. There’s nothing
like mud, when all is said and done,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
and it’s a perfect shame there isn’t
more mud about, nowadays; or
sand, at least. You should see them
go for it, when the streets are up.
Because the park is too far away for
most of them. And then, the fact
of the matter is, our boys don’t
much like playing in the park, anyhow;
and the few who care about
it aren’t allowed to go, because their
mothers say “You’ve got no
clothes.” They prefer the streets;
and that’s the truth, though you
wouldn’t believe it. I can’t stop to
tell you why. For one thing, the
keeper is always coming up in the
park and interfering; next, they
can’t find kerbs and paving-stones
there; next, it makes them wild to
see other boys with bats and things,
when they have none....</p>

<p>Some of these games used to come
in at fixed seasons, as <span class="allsmcap">TOPS</span> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">MARBLES</span> and <span class="allsmcap">PICTURES</span> and <span class="allsmcap">BUTTONS</span>
still do; they came regularly, like
the ice-cream jack or the lavender-boy
or the rate-collector or the
measles or the hoky-poky man or
the carol-singers. But things are
changing. <span class="smcap">Skipping</span> used to begin
on Good Friday, and now they skip
half the year round; <span class="allsmcap">HOOPS</span> used
to come in at Christmas sharp, and
here they are already. Danged if I
know the reason why. But there it
is. <span class="smcap">Grottoes</span> ought to be played
on St. James’ day, and I’ve seen
them in mid-winter. The same with
these <span class="allsmcap">MUD-PIES</span>. You would think
they belonged naturally to the wet
season. Not a bit of it! Not nowadays,
at all events. If their clay is
too dry in summer, they manage to
make it moist again, even without
waiting for the rain. Unseasonable,
I call it....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>What I said about paving-stones
reminds me of <span class="allsmcap">MARBLES</span>. We used to
play them in the winter, on the
pavement. But marlies are going
down in the world, that’s certain.
It’s a good while since I played,
but I still remember the names of
a few kinds—Toms, and Alleys, and
Glarnies, and Miggies; and Forty-eighter
and Twenty-fourer and
Twelver and Sixer and Fourer and
Three-er. You hardly ever hear of
a Forty-eighter nowadays. The
smaller stone marbles were called
Tich; those you got out of lemonade
bottles were Glass-eye; they also
had names, which I’ve forgotten,
according to the different coloured
marks. We used to play at <span class="allsmcap">NOCKS</span>
(that is, <span class="allsmcap">KNUCKS</span>: because your
knuckles had to touch the ground),
and <span class="allsmcap">MARBLE-BOARD</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">SKITTLES</span>,
and <span class="allsmcap">GLASGOW</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">THREE HOLES</span>, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">NIXY’S IN THE HOLE</span>: <span class="allsmcap">I TAKE</span>, and
<span class="allsmcap">GUTTER MARBLES</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">ROW MARBLES</span>,
and <span class="allsmcap">UP THE ALLEY</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">SPICK AND
SPAN</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">DOB ’EM</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">TIP</span>, and
<span class="allsmcap">FOUR HOLES</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">NEAREST THE WALL</span>,
and <span class="allsmcap">PICKING THE PLUMS</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">GOING
UP</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">BOWLING IN THE HOLE</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">HIT IT LEAVE IT</span> and <span class="allsmcap">HIT IT HAVE IT</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">THROWINGS OUT</span> and <span class="allsmcap">STAYS</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">HITS AND SPANS</span> and <span class="allsmcap">FIVE TEN</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">PICKING NUMBERS</span> and <span class="allsmcap">BAGATELLE</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">IN THE RING</span> and <span class="allsmcap">PITCHING</span> and <span class="allsmcap">FOLLOW
ON</span> and <span class="allsmcap">KILLING</span> and <span class="allsmcap">PORKY</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">THROW THE FARTHEST</span> and <span class="allsmcap">SOME OR
NONE</span> and <span class="allsmcap">BRIDGE-BOARD</span>. <span class="smcap">Bridge-board</span>
was played with a diagram
looking like a row of railway arches;
and I might explain the game if I
could draw diagrams, which I can’t.
In <span class="allsmcap">BOUNCE EYE</span> each player gave a
certain number of marbles which
were pooled in a ring. Then one
of them held a marble to his eye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
and dropped it among them; if
any others were knocked out of
the ring, he kept them; if none,
his own marble went into the pool.
There used also to be games that
you played with marbles in a flat
iron ring—the rings cost 2d. if you
bought them, but you generally got
them off the barges for nothing—games
like <span class="allsmcap">RINGUMS</span> and <span class="allsmcap">CHIPPING
OUT OF THE RING</span>.</p>

<p>But, as I was saying, marbles are
not played as they used to be. The
police are getting more interfering
every day; they tell the boys to move
on and not block up the pavement,
and that interrupts them in the
middle of a game and makes them
half wild; and if you don’t clear
off at once, they kick your marbles
into the gutter where they get lost
down a drain, and that makes you
altogether mad. Aunt Eliza explains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
things by saying that marble-games
wear out boys’ clothes at the knees
and that mothers are growing to
be “more careful in such matters.”
More fussy, I call it. And then she
says—and I say what she says simply
can’t be believed, though it would
prove what <i>I</i> said—she says—and I
say she says these things not because
she knows them but just because
she believes them, or believes she
believes them, or believes she ought
to believe them, like some people
do; or perhaps not even that;
because how is she to <i>know</i> them:
that’s what I want to know?—she
says that marbles—and I say it’s
the worst of Aunt Eliza that when
she says a thing you never know
exactly where you are; and, upon
my word, I don’t believe she knows
either; nor does anybody else, for
that matter; and, what’s more,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
nobody really cares; and it wouldn’t
much matter if they did, which is
just as well—she says that marbles—and
I say it all comes from wasting
her time running all over the place
in a feather hat and silk garters,
ever since she came in for that little
bit and left off trying to be schoolmistress,
and messing about the way
she has done with children’s homes
and a lot of old cranks, instead of
doing some honest work at home—she
says that marbles, and not only
marbles but <span class="allsmcap">HOOPS</span>, used to be played
by the big boys at the public schools.</p>

<p>Hoops: that’s what she says. And
I say: hoops be blowed. With all
respect to Aunt Eliza, I might have
swallowed marbles, but I can’t
swallow hoops; not on this side of
the year after next. I know this,
at least, that if a big lad were seen
playing, or ever had been seen playing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
with a hoop, down our way,
except, perhaps, an iron one—why,
his own parents wouldn’t know him
again, when he got home, if he
ever did, which I rather doubt;
and that’s all there is to it. His
father would ask whether some poor
loony had been trying to box with
a traction-engine going at full
steam, and his mother would want
to know what on earth made somebody
put a lot of something through
the sausage-machine without sifting
out all those buttons first. But that’s
neither here nor there, except in
so far as it shows what Aunt Eliza’s
explanations are worth. Mr. Perkins,
of Framlingham Brothers (a good
old firm—and a nice place he’s got,
too)—he’s an understandable kind
of gentleman and he gets talking
about things after his second pint
of Burton and he says, speaking of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
marbles, that he’s noticed the same
thing as I have. And when I asked
him <i>why</i> marbles are going out of
fashion, he says:</p>

<p>“Marbles are going out of
fashion”, he says, “because they’re
getting unpopular. That’s why.
And I happen to know this”,
says he, “because our little Percy
he tells me that shopmen don’t
stock them the way they did
because they know that boys don’t
ask for them the way they did and
boys don’t ask for them the way they
did because they know they couldn’t
get them the way they did because
shopmen don’t stock them the way
they did. Which proves what I
said. Trust me”, says he, “when
things begin to lose their popularity,
they are sure to become unfashionable
sooner or later, whether it be
games, or clothes, or drinks, <i>or</i> religions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
For instance”, says he,
“take Nonconformity”. But I
wasn’t taking Nonconformity just
then, and when I tried to keep him
to the point, and asked <i>why</i> marlies,
and just marlies, were getting unpopular,
he scratches his chin which
hadn’t been shaved for the inside of
a week, and has another go at his
tankard, and puts it down with a
bit of a bang, emphatic-like—a sure
sign, with Mr. Perkins—and then
he looks at me and says:</p>

<p>“Marbles are getting unpopular”,
says he, “because they’re going out
of fashion. That’s what’s the matter
with marbles and with a good many
other things as well. Take Nonconformity”,
and when I told him I
was only taking bitter that night,
he has another pull at his Burton,
and at last he says, casual-fashion:</p>

<p>“Marbles are not stimulating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
enough for modern life. It’s the
same with religions, <i>don’t you see</i>?
Now take Nonconformity”—and
God’s truth! I had to take Nonconformity
for the better part of
an hour, after all.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>But Mr. Perkins hit the nail on the
head, all the same. For I feel sure that
boys need more excitement than they
did. Or perhaps I ought to say they
want it. That’s it: they just want
it. And thinking it over, I believe
the cinematograph is to blame: it
makes them want more excitement,
and then it gives it them; and then
it makes them want still more, and
then it gives them still more; quite
restless, in fact, it makes them, and
I shouldn’t be surprised if sooner
or later it weren’t responsible for a
new kind of boy altogether. And that
would mean the end of a number of
these old games. Because nowadays
the bigger lads, those who used to
do most of the inventing—they prefer
to go to picture-shows whenever they
get a chance, instead of larking about
the streets as they used to do. (They
get some games out of the cinematograph,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
by the way, such as <span class="allsmcap">COWBOYS—INDIANS</span>,
which has lately been
re-christened <span class="allsmcap">GERMANS—ENGLISH</span>).
So the playing-age is growing to
be younger and younger, and these
small boys are not so good at discovering
fresh sports; it’s quite
true they do make up new ones
every day, but I think, on the whole,
they forget more than they ought
to remember; and this is the reason,
if you really want to know, why I’m
making up this catalogue: to see
whether the next lot of children
knows anything about these sports,
or even their names.</p>
</div>

<p>The “organized games” they make
them play in the parks nowadays—they
work in the same direction; so
does the regular county council
schooling; so does the scout movement.
The fact is, boys are not left
to themselves the way they used to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
be; everybody goes fussing about
and telling them to do this and that,
when they want to be doing something
else—something of their own;
that’s why many games are being
forgotten. I don’t know a single
boy who really cares for “organized
games” the way a man does; even
Aunt Eliza can’t bring herself to
believe in the system over-much,
though she likes to think it keeps
the youngsters out of mischief. And
it all comes from thinking that boys
think the same as we think—which
they don’t; or ought to learn to
think the same as we think—which
they oughtn’t. Because the right
kind of boy thinks differently from
the right kind of man about games
and everything else. And so he
ought.</p>

<p>To prove that they still can invent,
you need only watch them at their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
picture-games—played with cigarette-cards
and all of them, of course,
absolutely new, seeing that these
cards were quite unknown up to
a few years ago. These picture
games have helped to do away with
marbles, for two reasons: firstly,
the boys are keener on them because
they’re more exciting; and secondly,
they’re cheaper. You have to pay
for marbles. But you don’t pay for
fag-pictures: you mump them, see?
And here the difference between our
games and those of richer people
comes in. The more expensive their
games are, the more they like to
play them; they don’t seem to care
about sports that are played with
nothing at all—the dearness is what
makes everybody want to go in for
them; whereas with our boys a
game can only be played if it’s cheap,
and if it costs nothing at all—why,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
then it becomes really popular, or
fashionable—as the case may be.
Now fag-cards are cheap, and no
mistake. That’s why you can play
so many games with them—<span class="allsmcap">EGGS
IN THE BUSH</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">SNAP</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">BANKER</span>
(or <span class="allsmcap">BANK</span>), and <span class="allsmcap">NEAREST THE WALL
TAKES</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">NEAREST THE WALL SPINS
UP</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">SEVENS</span> (quite a new kind), and
<span class="allsmcap">SCALING UP THE RING</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">SCALING
UP THE LINE</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">UNDER THE HAT</span>,
and <span class="allsmcap">GETTING IN THE RING</span> (that’s a

(or <span class="allsmcap">SNOWFALLS</span>) and <span class="allsmcap">SPANS</span> (or
<span class="allsmcap">SPANNERS</span>)—there’s thirty of them,
anyhow.</p>

<p>There’s this to be said for picture-games:
they make the boys uncommonly
nimble with their hands and
fingers, and this must help them
later on, if they go in for certain
trades like watch-making. In fact,
they require real skill; as I found
out the other day when they asked
me to play <span class="allsmcap">BANKER</span> (just for a lark,
they said) and got five coppers out
of me in about half as many minutes.
No, I’ve nothing against picture-games
except that their names are
not as good as those of the duty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
sports and that they don’t give the
youngsters any chance of running
about and using their legs. And
also this: they’re really horrible
inducements to gambling—especially
<span class="allsmcap">BANKER</span>. Now I don’t like even
talking about gambling, because it’s
forbidden by law, and everybody
knows it. And yet, only yesterday
I noticed a lot of them at it; evidently
at it. I could see they were
up to mischief, by the way they
cleared. Dam funny it was—how
they just melted into nothing, before
I could get a proper sight of them.
Not our boys, I’m glad to say.</p>

<p>They’re so keen on these picture-games
that you can see them playing
at half-past six in the morning and
after nine at night; and in the
rain, too; and when they have no
fag-pictures they try to play the
same games with bus tickets and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
then, if you’re not very careful, you
can hear some shocking bad swear-words
which they pick up I can’t
think where, because the bus tickets
bend too easily and won’t fly as they
should.</p>

<p>And that reminds me of some
other games of the smaller children—those
played with five stones (boys)
or gobs and bonsers (girls). Gobs
(cobs) are shaped like dice, or ought
to be; and a bonser or bonk or
buck or bonster is a large marble
that bounces from the ground
(bouncer), about the size of a forty-eighter.
You can buy four gobs and
a bonk for a half-penny; you can
also make them yourself—the gobs
or stones, I mean—out of bits of
porcellain and pebbles and winkle-shells;
but the bought ones are
the best, because, for one reason,
you have to pay for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>With these things you play <span class="allsmcap">BUCK
AND FOUR</span> of different kinds, such as
<span class="allsmcap">TELLINGS</span> and <span class="allsmcap">SISTERS</span> and <span class="allsmcap">STAND UP
JACK</span>. For <span class="allsmcap">BASKETS</span> you need a diagram
on the pavement, which I
can’t draw. Other games of this
sort are <span class="allsmcap">ALLEY GOBS</span> and <span class="allsmcap">CHANGES</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">PICKSES</span> and <span class="allsmcap">STANDSES</span>—</p>

<p>“The way to play Saving Babies
life is like this. First of all you
pick out a stone which will be the
bonk, then lay the remaining four
on the left hand, and then by hitting
the hand which holds the stones
one of them flies into the air, then
when it comes down the player
must catch it or else he is out. When
all the stones have been caught in
this way they are laid on the hand
in two’s, then in three’s, and when that
is done all the four are caught, but this
time the bonk must be picked up
while the others are coming down.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>It takes some doing, this game;
and it isn’t worth doing when you
can do it.</p>

<p>Now proper boys won’t touch a
marble that bounces from the
ground—I can’t tell you why, but
there it is; so they generally use a
fifth stone instead of a bonk, as in
this last game, which is the boys’
way of “Saving Baby’s Life”.
But most of them don’t care about
these things anyhow, and I don’t
either; rotten games, I call them,
fit for silly little girls and only
interesting because they’re a sort
of half-way (the old <span class="allsmcap">FIVE-STONES</span>,
for instance, is played both with
common stones and with gobs)
between marbles which you can’t
manufacture at any price and real
stones which you just pick up anywhere.</p>

<p>Talking of real stones, there’s no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
doubt whatever that games played
with them are the oldest in the
world, together with the mud-larks—excepting
perhaps those that are
not played with <i>things</i> at all, like
hide-and-seek and some of the old
“he” games. And it’s just wonderful
what you can do with stones.
But they are dying out, all the
same; because the worst of it is,
there are not half enough stones
about, nowadays; not half enough.
You can play <span class="allsmcap">DUMPING</span> (or <span class="allsmcap">DUMPLING</span>)
with stones, and <span class="allsmcap">BUNG</span> (also
called <span class="allsmcap">GO-GULLEY</span>) and <span class="allsmcap">NIP</span> (also
called <span class="allsmcap">TAP</span> or <span class="allsmcap">LEG-ALONG</span>—where
you hit each others’ stones, each
hit counting ten) and <span class="allsmcap">DUCK</span>; and
you can tell from these names how
old the games are. Stones for
<span class="allsmcap">LEG-ALONG</span>—stones of the right
kind, of proper shape and weight,
flat on both sides and fitting nicely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
into the hand, are hard to come
by and carefully kept. <span class="smcap">Duck</span> (or
<span class="allsmcap">DUCK ON</span>) goes like this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“About eight or nine can play;
you make a hole in the ground and
Duck puts his stone before it, then
the Others come up close and have
to knock his one into the hole with
theirs; if they miss they must pick
up there stones and run back to
the Curb before he can catch his
One; if he catch him, that man is
Duck instead.”</p>
</div>

<p>Other stone-games are <span class="allsmcap">FRENCH
PACKET</span> and <span class="allsmcap">SHUFFING THE MONEY</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">FIVE-TEN</span> and <span class="allsmcap">HESLING</span> and <span class="allsmcap">TWO
AND THREE HOLES</span> and <span class="allsmcap">KNOCKING

STONE</span> and <span class="allsmcap">PUDDING</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>Have you ever played <span class="allsmcap">DUCKING
MUMMY</span>? Probably not. But it’s a
good old stone-game for small boys.
Two of them take a stone each,
and with these stones they aim at
a third stone. The third stone—that’s
Mummy. If one of them hits
Mummy, he keeps on throwing till
he misses; then the other has a
turn at it; and so on. In the end
they are supposed to count up who
has made most hits—the loser paying
a peppermint. Of course they try
to cheat each other, and so it always
ends in a free fight: that’s the best
part of the whole game. Nobody
ever gets the peppermint.</p>

<p>But they sometimes gets a black
eye....</p>

<p>And that’s about all the games I
can think of, just now.</p>

<p>Wait a bit. There are the chalk-games.
These are what you see
marked out in white or coloured
chalk on the pavement or asphalt—summer
games, of course, and
pretty common everywhere. Ordinary
<span class="allsmcap">HOP-SCOTCH</span>, for instance, and
<span class="allsmcap">LONG HOP-SCOTCH</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">FRENCH HOP-SCOTCH</span>,
and <span class="allsmcap">TIDDLEDEWINK</span>, and
<span class="allsmcap">PUDDING AND BEEF</span> (or <span class="allsmcap">STONE HOP-SCOTCH</span>,
where you have to keep a
stone balanced on your head or open
hand as you hop through). Then
there’s <span class="allsmcap">WRIGGLY-WORM</span> (also called
<span class="allsmcap">WHIRLY-WHIRLY</span>, or <span class="allsmcap">WIGGLY-WOGGLY</span>,
or <span class="allsmcap">SNAIL</span>), and <span class="allsmcap">SQUARES</span>, and
<span class="allsmcap">NUMBERS</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">DOT-BOXES</span> (or <span class="allsmcap">DOTS</span>)
and <span class="allsmcap">ALL OVER THE WORLD</span>, and
<span class="allsmcap">STEPPING-STONES</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">ZIG-ZAG</span>.
They play <span class="allsmcap">NOUGHTS AND CROSSES</span> out
of doors (<span class="allsmcap">OXEN-CROSSES</span>, they call it;
which shows how they twist the
names about); other chalk-games<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
are <span class="allsmcap">MAPS</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">LONDON</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">BATTLEMENTS</span>,
and <span class="allsmcap">SNAKES</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">BABY</span>, and
<span class="allsmcap">BILL BAILY</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>They also play <span class="allsmcap">BODY-BUILDING</span> of
different kinds, and one of the most
complicated of these chalk-games is
now called <span class="allsmcap">GERMANS-ENGLISH</span>. It
begins with a design shaped rather
like a coffin with fields of squares
in the middle and a field of them
running along each side, and a field
for “lost” at the top and another
field at the bottom which I don’t
remember the use of, and two starting-points
at each end of the bottom.
Only two boys can play; they throw
their nickers by turns into the middle
fields, and if they land on a line it
counts nothing, but whoever lands
in a field can begin building a soldier
in the corresponding side-field; first
his head; then (for another throw
into the right field) his body; then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
(for another) his legs; then his
rifle; then a bullet at the end of
his rifle. Once the bullet is there,
that soldier stands for good. But
while he is still being built, the
other boy, if he throws well, can set
up another soldier in the corresponding
side-field in shorter time, and
once that soldier has his bullet—why,
he can shoot the other fellow opposite,
if he’s not complete, and finish
him off for good. So there are all
the time soldiers building in the
different side-fields on both sides,
each growing up as fast as he can,
and all shooting each other whenever
they get the chance; and the winner
is the boy who has most soldiers
alive at the end. And you can see
from this that it’s a complicated
business and shows what youngsters
can think out with a bit of chalk
(if somebody didn’t think it out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
for them); but to explain it properly
would require at least twenty diagrams
to show the game in its different
stages, and I can’t draw diagrams—never
could; which is a pity.</p>

<p>The small children have a chalk-game
all to themselves called <span class="allsmcap">POLLY
POLLY WHAT’S THE TIME</span>, where they
draw a sort of clock on the pavement
and cover up parts of it with their
jackets or anything else.</p>

<p>The girls have another, <span class="allsmcap">BOOTS,
SHOES, TIPS, OR NAILS</span>, in which one
of them draws a square on the pavement
containing room for the four
letters b. t. s. or n.; she writes one
of them down and then covers it
up; the others must guess which
letter it is, and they score up how
many correct guesses each one has
had. Boys sometimes play this, but
not often.</p>

<p>And then the well-known <span class="allsmcap">CHALK-CHASE</span>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
There are different kinds of
<span class="allsmcap">CHALK-CHASE</span>, such as <span class="allsmcap">CONVICTS AND
WARDERS</span> (or <span class="allsmcap">TRACKING THE CONVICTS</span>)
and <span class="allsmcap">SCOUTS</span>; but the real old <span class="allsmcap">CHALK-CHASE</span>,
as played by my friends of
the “Char-charcoal-chalk-chase-club”,
goes like this:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You pick parteis and then they
clip for First outing. Each player
has a peice of chalk which he has to
draw arroes the hounds follow &amp;
they must cross out the arroes until
the Others are caught then its the
Others turn”.</p>
</div>

<p>Played it yourself, maybe?</p>

<p>And there! I nearly forgot some
of the best of all these sports: the
touch games. There’s <span class="allsmcap">OFF-GROUND
TOUCH</span> and <span class="allsmcap">FRENCH TOUCH</span> and <span class="allsmcap">TOUCH
THE ROAD YOU MUST GO OVER</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">CROSS TOUCH</span> and <span class="allsmcap">HE</span> (called <span class="allsmcap">EE</span>; all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
touch-games are “he” games, and
this is the grandfather of the whole
family), and <span class="allsmcap">ELBOW TOUCH</span> and <span class="allsmcap">HELP
TOUCH</span> and <span class="allsmcap">B—TOUCH</span> and <span class="allsmcap">TOUCHING
BOOTLEATHER</span> and <span class="allsmcap">HOP TOUCH</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">DOUBLE TOUCH</span> and <span class="allsmcap">TOUCH LAST</span> (or
<span class="allsmcap">HAD YOU LAST</span>) and <span class="allsmcap">TOUCHING IRON</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">TOUCH WOOD AND WHISTLE</span> and
<span class="allsmcap">NON-STOP TOUCH</span> and <span class="allsmcap">STICK-TOUCH</span>,
or <span class="allsmcap">STICK-HE</span> (touching with sticks)
and <span class="allsmcap">WATER-HE</span> (played in the baths)
and <span class="allsmcap">STRING-HE</span> (touch and hold
hands: like <span class="allsmcap">WIDDY</span>) and <span class="allsmcap">TREE-HE</span> (up
trees) and <span class="allsmcap">SHADOW-HE</span>, which must be
played in the sunshine, like this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The one who is he has to try
and tread on one of the person’s
shadders, then he is he.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">French touch</span> is as good as any of
those I can remember just now; it
is played like this:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Fr tutch run after another boy

where he tutched and go ea and run
after another boy and tutch him
any were and he has to keep his hand
on the place were he tutched and go
ea and run after another boy and
tutch him any were etc.”—</p>
</div>

<p>and <span class="allsmcap">OFF-GROUND TOUCH</span> like this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You are not supposed to let
your feet touch the ground, if you
do, the one who is out can have
you”—</p>
</div>

<p>but somebody really ought to make
a full list of games of this kind.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
Aunt Eliza might do it (always fussing
about with school-children, she is,
and seeing that their clothes are
properly patched behind) if she
weren’t so fond of explaining things—so
fond that I daresay she’ld mix
up <span class="allsmcap">B—TOUCH</span> with <span class="allsmcap">HOOPS</span> and <span class="allsmcap">HONEY-POTS</span>,
for the sake of fitting it in with
some explanation or other. That’s
the worst of Aunt Eliza; she’s
sometimes right, but you never know
when....</p>

<p>And now, come to think of it, I
believe I can tell you just one or two
more of the games they play down
our way. There’s <span class="allsmcap">WILL YOU ’LIST</span>
(a recruiting game, very popular just
now), and <span class="allsmcap">HAMMERS ON</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">KICKS</span>,
and <span class="allsmcap">RED ROVER</span> (“Three steps and
I’ll be over”), and <span class="allsmcap">CARLOW</span>, and
<span class="allsmcap">FRIED EGGS AND A RASHER</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">POSTMAN’S
KNOCK</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">TEN O’CLOCK

<span class="allsmcap">ICKAMY-ICKAMY-CO</span> (“where’s the
poor man to go?”), and <span class="allsmcap">SHUNTING
ENGINES</span> and <span class="allsmcap">FOLLOW THE LEADER</span>—</p>

<p>It’s the only really dangerous
game we have, <span class="allsmcap">FOLLOW THE LEADER</span>.
Because of course the bravest boy
is chosen as leader, one who crosses
the road just in front of some heavy
van and then goes and raps at all
the doors of the neighbours who
rush out in a rage to see what’s the
matter; so that by the time the
third man has done the same there’s
sometimes a smash-up and always a
row. A grand old game is <span class="allsmcap">DOING
EACH OTHERS’ DAGS</span>, as they call it;
but its bound to end in trouble of
some kind, for dead certain; though
the “leader” generally comes off
without a scratch, as they do in the
army—</p>

<p>and <span class="allsmcap">STITCH AWAY TAILOR</span> and <span class="allsmcap">BOATS</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">HOOPLA FOR CHOKLITTS</span> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span> <span class="allsmcap">BUS

<span class="allsmcap">KNOCKING DOWN GINGER</span> and <span class="allsmcap">KNOCKING

<span class="allsmcap">WHIRLIGIG</span> and <span class="allsmcap">ROBIN SNATCH</span> (with

I’m glad I didn’t forget to remember
<span class="allsmcap">JUPITER</span>; it’s an old game and goes
like this:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“One has to be Jubiter and every

(like <span class="allsmcap">WIDDY</span>) and <span class="allsmcap">DATE-HOGS</span>—</p>

<p>I must tell you about <span class="allsmcap">DATE-HOGS</span>.
It’s played by small children with
date-stones and screws—the stones
you find, the screws you pinch or
mump; and each boy has a certain
number of throws with his date-stones
at one of the other chap’s
screws standing up on end. Now
it’s quite clear that, getting the
screws the way they do, they sometimes
get big ones, and sometimes
little ones, and have to be jolly glad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
to get any at all; and it’s also clear
that, big screws being easier to hit
than little ones, the game would be
unfair if you always threw from the
same distance. Therefore you mustn’t
always throw from the same distance.
But how are you to settle it fairly?
Well, everybody knows that big
screws have more turns or twists
in them than little screws have. So
they measure the throwing-distance
by the number of these turns. A
small screw, which is hard to hit,
has (say) five turns, so you have to
stand five paces off; a big screw,
which is easier to hit, has (say) ten
turns, and so you stand ten paces
off; and this makes the chances
always even. Shows how artful these
kids are—</p>

THE POPPY-SHOW</span>—</p>

<p>A poppy-show—that’s a puppet-show,
if the boys hadn’t forgotten
what a puppet-show was. You need
rather a fresh boy for this game,
and when you’ve found him, you get
hold of a big book—a Bible, if possible,
because it has so many pages
and looks respectable anyhow, but
chiefly on account of the pages—and
anywhere between its pages you
put a few transfers; just a few.
You hold the book in your hand
with the back downwards and press
the covers together as tightly as ever
you can, and come up to your lad
and say “A pin to look at the poppy-show.”
Then he, with a pin, has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
to dab down between the closed pages
of the book, and if he strikes a place
where a transfer happens to be, of
course it’s his; otherwise, you keep
his pin. You can guess his chances,
when there are about three transfers
hidden among four hundred pages.
If he likes to be a fool, he can get rid
of all his pins that way, while you
keep your poppy-show for the next
fresh boy you come across—</p>

<p>In this, you go up to a boy smaller
than yourself and take him by the
throat and say “Pin, button, or
marble”. And that’s all you have
to do. Because then he must turn
out his pockets and give you whatever
he can find, and thank God<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
if he doesn’t get a thrashing into
the bargain. It isn’t exactly what
you’ld call even chances, but it’s
quite all right, especially if you
happen to be the big boy; because
the big boy generally wins at this
game. Now you may wonder why
they collect pins. Well, our boys
will collect anything, anyhow, anywhere—even
if it’s useless; but
precious few things, you know, are
really useless (I can’t think of a
single one, just now), and as to pins—I’m
not even going to try to tell you
in how many ways you need them.
Some boys go about with a provision
of hundreds of pins stuck in their
clothes for different sports; mothers
are also very fond of pins, and if
you give them a nice handful on a
Saturday morning, they’ll think
you’ve been quietly thinking about
them all the week and collecting pins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
for them; and maybe that’ll mean an
extra something for the picture-show
later on. They collect buttons the
same way, for games like <span class="allsmcap">BUTTONS
IN THE RING</span>; only the buttons must
be of metal, of brass or steel; they
must ring like money when you
throw them on the pavement: that’s
the test. All other buttons are simply
“toot”—not worth talking about.
The best metal buttons are commissionaires’
buttons; they’re called
“raileys”, and a good railey is
worth four or even six ordinary
metal ones, while a bad one (with a
loose shank, for instance) will fetch
only two. Many boys are able to
stitch themselves full of these
buttons, for use in games; the less
clever ones, those who keep on
losing them, have to cut the buttons
from their own clothes and go about
from one year’s end to another with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
their trowsers hitched to their
braces by means of their sisters’
hair-pins, bent double. But that’s

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Plaster of Paris has lost his hat—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some say this, and some say that....”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and that’s interesting, because
“Plaster of Paris”, of course, is
all nonsense. And so is “Plaistow
Palace”, as they sometimes call it.
The real song goes:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Beadle Palace has lost his hat—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some say this, and some say that....”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>but the boys twist the words about,
because they disremember who
Beadle Palace was; and I can’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
tell you either. Mr. Perkins, of
Framlingham Brothers (Limited),
once told me he knew all about it;
he said that “Beadle Palace” stands
for the Bishop of London, who
<i>really did</i> lose his hat one evening;
and “some say” it was blown off
his head by the wind, and “some
say” he gave it to a woman with red
hair and a squint, and never got it
back again. But he was a bit on,
that night, was Mr. Perkins. Or else
the Bishop must have been....</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>
<p>These are about a thousand of
the outdoor games they play down
our way—not a bad number, when
you think that our children can only
play after they come home from
school or work, and that they hardly
ever play on Sundays on account
of their clothes, or in winter because
the evenings are too dark, and that
the rain often keeps them indoors
anyhow, and that the lads over 14
don’t play at all. And yet, no doubt,
I must have forgotten to tell you
half of them; and I shall never
stop forgetting, if I don’t stop trying
to remember....</p>
</div>

<p>Now what I think is this. It
doesn’t matter how all these sports
are played. What matters is that
they <i>are</i> played. To show how wide-awake
our youngsters are, to be
able to go on inventing games out
of their heads all the time—that’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
the point: my point, at least. The
particular rules of all these different
games—they don’t strike me as very
important, or even interesting.</p>

<p>And you’ll agree with me that it’s
as clear as daylight, and it all comes
to this: if you want to see what
children can do, you must stop
giving them things. Because of
course they only invent games
when they have none ready-made
for them, like richer folks have—when,
in other words, they’ve
nothing in their hands. As Mr.
Perkins said: “You can’t play a
ball-game, if you haven’t got a ball”,
meaning that if you want to play,
and have nothing to play with, you
must play at something that doesn’t
need anything. Give them bats
and balls, and they soon forget their
<span class="allsmcap">CHINESE ORDERS</span>, and there’s an end
of <span class="allsmcap">SHOWING NO IVORY</span>, and nobody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
thinks of <span class="allsmcap">PULLING OUT FATHER’S
RHUBARB</span>, and <span class="allsmcap">OLD DEVIL</span> may go to—well,
where he came from. That’s
what keeps them alive and “imaginative”
(as Aunt Eliza would say)—having
nothing to play with.
That’s what makes them use up
all they can find—clay and kerbstones
and nuts and winkle-shells and
clothes and empty condensed-milk
tins and walls and caps and stones
and window-sills and buttons and
doorsteps and lamp-posts and rags
and anything else that comes handy.
And that’s how they come to play
any number of games and to discover
new ones every day, while better-class
lads get into grooves and go
on with their frowsy old cricket and
one or two more all the time, always
the same, year after year.</p>

<p>Not that I’m saying anything
against <span class="allsmcap">CRICKET</span> in particular. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
can do many things with a bat.
But there are many more things
you can’t do. And all these other
things are bound to be left outside
your reach in the long run, if you
get taken up by cricket. Because,
you see, you don’t take up cricket—you
think you do, but you don’t;
you get taken up. You think you are
going to do what you please with a
bat, but the fact is, the bat does what
it pleases with you; you think it’s
your servant, but in reality it’s a
master who drives you along the
way he means to go—or rather, the
only way he can go (that is, hitting
a ball). It’s perfectly true that you
can play well or badly; but, play
as you like, you can’t help your
faculty for inventing something outside
bats and balls getting rustier
all the time. And it’s true that
cricket saves you the trouble of inventing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
those other games; that’s
just its drawback, I say. No getting
out of the rut! With the bat in your
hand, you can only do what it allows
you to do. Which is a good deal;
but not half as much as if your hand
were empty.</p>

<p>And what Mr. P. said of ball-games
applies to all the others that
are played with <i>things</i>. Say you want
to have a go at <span class="allsmcap">WRIGGLY-WORM</span>.
Right! But you can’t mark out a
pattern in chalk if you have no chalk
to do it with. That’s clear. And
you haven’t always got a lump of
chalk in your pocket; now, have you?
And then you feel about and turn
them inside out and find you have
not only no chalk but nothing else—absolutely
nothing at all; not a top
or a marble, no, not even a konker
or a nicker or a bus-ticket. And
then?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>Why, then, if you can’t invent
something different, something jolly
well altogether out of your head,
where are you? Because, of course,
you’ve got to play something or
other—unless you want to be a soppy
fathead. And our youngsters don’t
want to be soppy fatheads. What’s
more, they aren’t. They try a good
many things, and often they succeed;
but they couldn’t be <i>that</i>, even if
they tried; which they don’t.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>
<p>POSTSCRIPT. Aunt Eliza writes to
say that she can’t explain what the
boys mean when they say “Obobé”,
but she feels sure it must be “something
not quite nice”. Thank God,
there’s one thing she can’t explain.
For my part, I think these words
like Obobé and A-lairy and Widdy
are the queerest thing of all, about
these sports. And what’s queerer
still are the names like Salmon
Fishing and Cold Pies and Blue Boy,
that make sense but have nothing
whatever to do with the games.</p>
</div>

<p>She also tells me that the song of
<i>London Bridge is broken down</i> goes
back to “bloodthirsty rites of foundation-sacrifice”
(read it in some book,
I daresay, and so thinks it must be
true), and that <i>Fie Sally, Cry Sally</i>
“originated in early water-worship”.
Early water-worship be blowed. Late
beer-worship is more my style. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
Aunt Eliza knows too much, anyhow;
so much, that I shall have to ask her
about the originating of the game of
<span class="allsmcap">DUCKING MUMMY</span>, and whether it
makes her think of a certain good old
custom. Then she says that <i>Here
we come gathering nuts in May</i> is
“a relic of Marriage by Capture”,
and some more stuff of that kind. No
doubt; no doubt. Aunt Eliza thinks
a good deal about Marriage by Capture—to
judge by her talk, at least.
Nobody ever tried to capture <i>her</i>,
you know. And nobody ever will,
I don’t think.</p>
